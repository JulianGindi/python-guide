# Python Guide

This is an attempt to document how I develop with Python with some tips and tricks along the way.

*Note: Always develop with Python3*

## Installing Python

#### Mac OSX

`brew install python3`


Any other reasonable development environment should have a working version.

## Dependency Management/Packages

**Use python virtual environments**

There are a few schools of thought here, but I primarily follow a two-tier approach to virtualenv creation:

* virtualenvwrapper
* pipenv
